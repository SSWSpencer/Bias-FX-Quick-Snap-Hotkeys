# Bias-FX-Quick-Snap-Hotkeys
Bias FX 2 is an amazing amp with horrible controls, and doesn't allow keyboard shortcuts.

This is a python script that will allow a user to use their keyboard to switch between quick snap presets.

1-8 Keys: Switch between presets
Left Arrow: Chronological Last Preset (Will go from 8 -> 7, then 7 -> 6) 
Right Arrow Chronological Next Preset (Will go from 6 -> 7, then 7 -> 8)
Space Bar: Previous preset (If you are on preset 2, and switch to 6, pressing space will flip between presets 2 and 6)
